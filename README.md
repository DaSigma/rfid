## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### RFID Not Reading Cards
- **Check wiring**: Verify SPI connections to ICSP header
- **Power supply**: Ensure 3.3V connection to RC522
- **Card distance**: Hold card 1-3cm from reader
- **Serial output**: Check for "Firmware Version" message on startup

#### LED Not Working
- **Wiring**: Verify VCC (5V), GND, and data pin connections
- **Power**: WS2812 requires 5V, not 3.3V
- **Library**: Ensure Adafruit_NeoPixel is installed
- **LED count**: Verify `NUM_LEDS` matches your strip

#### Magnetic Lock Issues
- **No lock control**: Check relay wiring and 12V power supply
- **Lock doesn't engage**: Verify relay switches 12V properly
- **Intermittent operation**: Ensure common ground between Arduino and 12V supply
- **Lock stays on**: Check relay normally-open (NO) connection

#### Cards Not Saving
- **EEPROM corruption**: Clear EEPROM and restart system
- **Power loss**: Cards save immediately when added/removed
- **Max cards reached**: System holds maximum 20 cards

### Serial Monitor Debug
Enable Serial Monitor (9600 baud) to see:
- Card UIDs when scanned
- System status messages
- Add/remove confirmations
- Error messages and troubleshooting info

### Factory Reset
To clear all stored cards:
1. Call `clearAllCardsFromEEPROM()` function
2. Or manually clear EEPROM address 0

## üîí Security Considerations

### Security Features
- **Encrypted storage**: Card UIDs stored in EEPROM
- **Master card protection**: Required for system changes
- **Access logging**: All events logged to serial output
- **Fail-safe design**: Lock releases on power failure

### Security Best Practices
- **Physical security**: Protect Arduino and power supply
- **Master card**: Keep master card secure and separate
- **Regular audits**: Monitor serial logs for unauthorized attempts
- **Power backup**: Consider UPS for critical applications

### Limitations
- **Card cloning**: RFID cards can potentially be cloned
